/**
 * Standing `/effort` opt-in (pi's answer to CC's ultracode): a session toggle that
 * auto-arms a workflow for substantive interactive messages, with effort-tier
 * guidance nudging fan-out breadth and the hard caps (tokenBudget / maxAgents) the
 * model should set on the workflow tool call.
 *
 * Honest scope: the runtime cannot enforce "reviewer N / loop K" — those live in
 * the script the model writes — so the tiers are guidance plus the model setting
 * the real hard caps (tokenBudget/maxAgents are genuine runtime ceilings). The
 * pre-flight ceiling-confirm dialog (roadmap P1-5 #4) is a downscope point: an
 * `input` hook transforms synchronously and can't await a confirm, so it is left
 * to a follow-up; `/effort` is explicit opt-in, which is the safety valve.
